## Updated Course Calendar

Based on our revised lecture order for better student understanding, the topics are reorganized as follows:

| Reference Week    | Practical                                                                                             |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1st Practice**  | **Introduction to Data Science**

| **5th Practice**      | **Spring Break /**                                                        |
| **6th Practice**  | **Matplotlib**

| **7th Practice**  | **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
Techniques for summarizing main characteristics of datasets through visualization and statistics.   |
| **8th Practice**  | **Regression**  
Introduction to supervised learning for continuous outcomes.                                        |
| **9th Practice**  | **Classification**  
Supervised learning for categorical outcomes.                                                       |
| **10th Practice**  | **Clustering**  
Unsupervised learning techniques to identify natural groupings in the data.                         |
| **11th Practice** | **Model Evaluation and Validation**  
Assessing model performance, cross-validation, and error metrics.                                   |

| **13th Practice** | **Review Class or Counseling Session**   

> [!NOTE]
> Semester Project
> Group Work or Individual Presentation at the end of the semester. 

> [!TIP]
> Learn the data science-based Python materials to prepare for the final project.
> Select a data type from the listed dataset websites below.
> Create a group by yourself and think about the semester project. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Presence is 100% MANDATORY; students must earn certain points to PASS the practice.
> Ten quizzes, at the beginning of each practical class
> Students can start the project work after the Spring break (Approximately can get 1 month to do this). 

> [!WARNING]
> Students may miss at most 4 classes

> [!CAUTION]
> If students miss more classes, they automatically FAIL the course!
