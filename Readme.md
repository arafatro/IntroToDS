> **Note:**  
> **Semester Project:**  
> Group Work or Individual Presentation at the end of the semester.
> 
> **Tip:**  
> Prepare for your final project by studying the data science-based Python materials.  
> Select a data type from one of the dataset websites listed below and form your project groups accordingly.
> 
> **Important:**  
> Attendance is MANDATORY; students must earn the required points to PASS the practical component.
> - Ten quizzes will be administered—one at the beginning of each practical class.
> - Project work may begin after the Spring break (students typically have about one month for project development).
> 
> **Warning:**  
> Students may miss at most 4 classes.
> 
> **Caution:**  
> Missing more than 4 classes will result in an automatic FAIL for the course!
